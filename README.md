# Basic concepts about ROS2 foxy

ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy is the seventh stable release of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) middleware. It was released in May 2020 and is named after the Australian marsupial, the red fox.

ROS2 Foxy is designed to be a more reliable, secure, and performant version of ROS, while maintaining compatibility with ROS1. It includes new features such as real-time support, improved performance, and better communication between nodes, as well as support for more platforms and operating systems.

ROS2 Foxy also provides a number of new tools and libraries for building robotic systems, including the new ROS2 Navigation System, which provides advanced algorithms for path planning, localization, and mapping, and the ROS2 Web Bridge, which allows for easy communication between ROS2 and web-based applications.
